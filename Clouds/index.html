To that end, we studied the precipitation processes in cold and warm clouds and the parameters like temperature and humidity that have to be taken into account before seeding a cloud.</p><h1>Parameters and processes in a cumulus cloud</h1><p>High in the clouds, precipitation usually begins to fall as snow in temperate regions like Belgium, even in summer. It depends on the vertical temperature distribution in the atmosphere in which form the precipitation reaches the earth's surface. If the temperature remains negative everywhere for example, snow will fall.</p><p>When clouds are formed, they consist of supercooled water droplets, ice crystals or a combination of these. However, precipitation is only formed when the particles have become sufficiently heavy and can therefore reach the earth's surface. For this to happen the cloud particles have to grow considerably: 1 raindrop contains about 5 million cloud droplets!</p><p>There are two processes that can cause the cloud particles to grow.</p><p>Coalescence is the process that explains the formation of rain in relatively warm clouds with temperatures ranging from -10 to -12 °C, consisting largely of supercooled water droplets. Some droplets are a bit bigger than the others and start to fall in the cloud. In doing so, they collide with other droplets which they then enclose. This process is called coalescence. When the drops have grown large enough, they can reach the ground. In our temperate regions, there is little rainfall from these so-called water clouds. However, in the tropics, where the atmosphere can contain much larger condensation cores due to the strong vertical movements, coalescence can cause heavy precipitation.</p><p>The Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen theory describes a second process in which cloud elements are transformed into precipitation. This process takes place in clouds in which supercooled water droplets and ice crystals occur together. These types of clouds are also called mixed clouds and have temperatures lower than -10 to -12 ° C.</p><p>At negative temperatures, air surrounding the ice crystals contain less water vapor than air surrounding the supercooled droplets. This means that the maximum vapor pressure above ice is lower than above water. This results in the precipitation of water vapor on the ice, which is called ripening, when the air is saturated. Due to the reduction of the water vapor in the air, the water droplets will evaporate. Next, the water vapor will ripen on the ice. The ice crystals will grow bigger and heavier and fall like snow.</p><p>The density of liquid water in a cumulus cloud changes depending on what height in the cloud you are measuring. At the base of the cloud, the concentration is 0 grams of liquid water per kilogram of air. As the height increases, the concentration increases rapidly to the maximum concentration near the center of the cloud. The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1.25 grams of water per kilogram of air. The concentration slowly decreased as the height increased to the height of the top of the cloud, where it immediately drops back to zero.</p><p>The height at which clouds form depend on the amount of moisture in the warm air layers in which the clouds form. Humid air generally results in a lower cloud base. In temperate regions, the base of the cumulus clouds is usually below 550 meters above the Earth's surface, but it can reach up to 2,400 meters. In dry and mountainous areas, the cloud base can exceed 6,100 meters.</p><p>Cumulus clouds can consist of ice crystals, water droplets, supercooled water droplets or a mixture thereof. When the temperature in these clouds reach temperatures of -10°C water droplets begin to freeze and become ice crystals. The concentration of droplets ranges from 23 to 1,300 droplets per cubic centimeter.</p><h1>Ice nucleation proteins (INPs)</h1><p>INPs are a family of proteins that are expressed on the outer membrane of several species of plant pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. The proteins make sure these bacteria can act as nuclei for the formation of ice crystals. This can happen at a higher temperature than normally possible when non-biological particles such as dirt for example act as nuclei. Therefore, a higher efficiency of ice nucleation is reached. These bacteria use this as a way to acquire nutrients from plant cells by damaging them through the formation of ice crystals. Furthermore, they also use their ice nucleation ability as a dispersal method to reach new hosts by inducing rain when they get in clouds (Morris et al., 2004). Pseudomonas syringae, which makes InaZ INPs, is the most studied INP producing bacteria. InaZ has been proven to be the most efficient INP (Han et al, 2017). For this reason, InaZ was chosen.</p><p>The reason for the high efficiency of InaZ and other INPs can be traced back to its structure and amino acid sequence. Although there still exists a lot of uncertainty regarding the exact structure, it is thought that the protein forms a beta helix structure. Moreover, a large part of its sequence is made out of a series of tandem repeats. These repeats consist of two fixed motifs each containing three amino acids. The helix is positioned in such a way that on one side of the helix represents the first motif while the second motif is represented at the opposite site. The amino acids of both motifs have two hydrophilic and two hydrophobic groups. The hydrophilic groups attract water molecules and the hydrophobic groups entrap them in between the helix loops. The resulting distances between the water molecules in the helix are very similar to those of water molecules in an ice lattice, making INP a perfect starting point to form one (Garnham et al., 2011).</p><h1>Cloud seeding with INPs in warm clouds</h1><p>As mentioned above, coalescence is the main process that drives the formation of precipitation in warm clouds. Hygroscopic particles, which attract water, can speed this up. This is why salts are commonly used for the cloud seeding of warm clouds. As INPs don’t have strong hygroscopic properties, it is unlikely they will have much use for warm clouds. As INPs don’t have strong hygroscopic properties, it is unlikely they will have much use for seeding warm clouds.</p><h1>What type of clouds can be seeded?</h1><p>As cloud seeding consists of artificially aiding (or, in the context of flood and storm prevention, inhibiting) the natural precipitation processes, it makes sense that clouds with the potential to form lots of precipitation are the main targets. Nimbostratus and cumulonimbus clouds are the typical rain clouds, with the latter often producing much more extreme weather than the former, like storms.</p><h1>Dynamic climate chambers</h1><p>Dynamic climate chambers are closed environments, in which multiple parameters such as temperature and relative humidity can be programmed. These dynamic climate chambers can be used to study many things including clouds. The parameters in a dynamic chamber can be set to specific values to mimic the conditions in a given cloud. This can then be used to see how different cloud seeding techniques might affect the cloud.</p><p>Specifically, dynamic climate chambers can be used to measure the influence the cloud seeding agent has on condensation and freezing.</p><h1>AgI and bacterial ghosts in cumulus clouds</h1><p>In order to compare AgI and the bacterial ghosts, one important factor is their size. An AgI particle in an aerosol for cloud seeding has a diameter of approximately 25 nm. The BG has about the same dimensions as an E. coli cell. A cylinder of 1.0 to 2.0 micrometers in length, with a radius of 0.05 micrometers. However, the BG will be slightly smaller since it will have its cell material removed and get lyophilized in order to be in an optimal form for the pneumatic dispersion method of the company cloud seeding technologies.</p><h1>Which parameters affect the seeding efficiency?</h1><p>Aerosols present: Aerosols can help with the seeding of clouds. Most of the time this is being done unintended by anthropogenic pollution. We &quot;seed&quot; the clouds negatively and inadvertently with pollution aerosols on a much grander scale than we do positively with IN and giant CCN. Being the two sides of the same coin (New insights to cloud seeding for enhancing precipitation and for hail suppression-Daniel Rosenfeld). I.e. The presence of pollution aerosols helps with the coalescence in the cloud, thus adding to the cloud seeding process. The problem here is that this actually does as much harm as cloud seeding with AgI because these pollutants will also drop down and intoxicate the soil.</p><p>Temperature, wind speed, air pressure: These parameters are all quite related. There is an optimal window for these variables that implies the best seeding conditions. Clouds are formed on average around 3000 meters above sea-level. At this height there is an average air pressure of 70 kPa. R. W. Shaffer has observed that the wind speed at this air pressure should be lower than 10 m/s for ideal seeding. In a cloud there is obviously a temperature gradient. Shaffer has recorded the top temperatures for the clouds he investigated with a rawinsonde and concluded that this top temperature should be greater than -29°C. The height in a cloud which corresponds with a temperature of -5°C should also be lower than 3000m. When staying in this window of optimal seeding he measured a seeding/no-seeding ratio of 2.14 which is measured by the amount of rainfall in mm over a period of three hours.</p><p>[15] Shaffer, R. (2012). Seeding agent threshold activation temperature height, an important seedability criterion for ground-based seeding. The Journal of Weather Modification, 15(1), 16-20.</p><p>Cloud size: Because of the previous parameters we can also deduct the influence of the cloud size. The horizontal dimensions of the cloud shouldn’t make that much difference, other than you would need a lot of seeding agent to cover this area if you want to seed the whole cloud. The vertical dimensions are quite more important. the top temperature optimally should be higher than -29°C so if the cloud reaches higher than the height corresponding with this air temperature, it would affect the seeding efficiency.</p><h1>An estimation of the number of BGs needed for cloud seeding</h1><p>In order to know how many BGs are needed for cloud seeding, we made an estimation based on the results of the 2016 iGEM team at UGhent called Dewpal.</p><div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/Description--josh-withers.jpg" alt="Picture by Josh Withers on Unsplash"><p>Figure 1: Picture by Josh Withers on Unsplash</p></div><h1>Recording References</h1><p>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research.
